###Organon is a tool for novelists and scientific authors.

Organon is a plugin for LibreOffice and OpenOffice.

Organon allows to split up large texts into parts, allows tagging and opening parts of the project in new tabs.

* Parts are shown in a treeview. Entries can be moved by drag and drop.
* Every entry can be tagged.
* Tags are freely configurable, can be renamed, created and deleted. Organon's Organizer is a fast way of showing and editing all tags at once.
* Tabs can be opened based on these tags. They also might freely be chosen from the folders and files of the project and they might be sorted by date and/or time.

Organon offers extensive import and export options.

Organon's projects are platform independent and might be edited on different computers and platforms.

####More Features are:
* (Batch) split and combine files
* Use Writer templates
* Create your own Organon templates.
* When displaying the files in a folder, the relevant section of the folder is always highlighted while editing the document.
